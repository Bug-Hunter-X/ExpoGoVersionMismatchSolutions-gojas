This error occurs when using the Expo CLI and managing different versions of Expo Go.  It usually manifests as an inability to start the development server, or when trying to run the app on a device using a newer version of Expo Go than the project is configured for.  The error message itself can vary but often involves issues with the Android or iOS build process, suggesting incompatibility between the project's Expo SDK version and the Expo Go client.
